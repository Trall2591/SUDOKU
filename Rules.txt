Sudoku is a puzzle based on a small number of very simple rules:
    1.Every square has to contain a single number
    2.Only the numbers from 1 through to 9 can be used
    3.Each 3x3 box can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
    4.Each vertical column can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
    5.Each horizontal row can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
Once the puzzle is solved, this means that every row, column, and 3x3 box
     will contain every number from 1 to 9 exactly once. 
In other words, no number can be repeated in any 3x3 box, row, or column. 
[W],[w] - up;
